Notes for Backend:
    1. Create an API to generate tokens for QR.
    2. Create API to validate token, username & password.
    3. API or Socket to get the Login Result in the Secured Device.

Notes for Frontend: 
    1. Create a page to show the QR code.
    2. Create a page to launch with a Username & Password when QR is scanned or while opening the URL from the QR.
    3. Create dummy success & failure pages.
